12. Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and 
makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. For practice, 
write this code inside a function.

def newList(lst):
    combinedList = []
    one = lst[0]
    last = lst[-1]
    combinedList.append(one)
    combinedList.append(last)
    return combinedList
    
newList([5, 10, 15, 20, 25])
