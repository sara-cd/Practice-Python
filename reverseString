15. Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words. 
Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order.

def reverseString(string):
    words = string.split()
    final = " ".join(reversed(words))
    return final
    
reverseString('My name is Michele')
